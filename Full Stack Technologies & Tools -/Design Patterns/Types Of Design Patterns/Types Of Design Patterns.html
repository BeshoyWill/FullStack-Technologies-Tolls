       <h1 data-trilium-h1>Types Of Design Patterns</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>â€“&gt; A <strong>design pattern</strong> is a reusable solution to a commonly
          occurring problem within a given context in software design. It serves
          as a blueprint or template for solving specific problems in software architecture
          and development, ensuring code is more maintainable, scalable, and efficient.
          Design patterns are not finished pieces of code but rather descriptions
          or guidelines for solving problems that can be implemented in various ways.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Patterns can be used across different projects
            to solve similar problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: They provide scalable solutions for large,
            complex systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Best Practices</strong>: They are proven solutions derived from
            the collective experiences of developers.</li>
          <li><strong>Readability</strong>: Enhance code clarity and structure, making
            it easier for teams to understand and collaborate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Categories of Design Patterns:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Creational Patterns</strong>: Focus on the instantiation of objects.
            <ul>
              <li>Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Structural Patterns</strong>: Deal with object composition and
            relationships.
            <ul>
              <li>Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Flyweight.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Behavioral Patterns</strong>: Concerned with communication and
            interaction between objects.
            <ul>
              <li>Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Visitor, Template Method,
                Iterator.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Why Design Patterns:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Avoid reinventing the wheel.</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Communication between software engineers using a common vocabulary.</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Leverage the power of the Object Oriented Programming design.</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
